### 1. Add a Chapter

In the course management section, click on "Add New Chapter" to start creating a new chapter for your course.

### 2. Set Chapter Details

Provide a title, description, duration and level for the chapter. This should clearly outline what the chapter covers and its learning objectives.

### 3. Set Chapter as Access Free

If you want the chapter to be accessible for free, even if the user hasn't paid for the course, toggle the "Access Free" option. This can serve as a teaser to encourage users to purchase the full course.

### 4. Add a Video

You can add a video to the chapter by providing a YouTube or Vimeo link, or by uploading a video file directly. Ensure the video quality is high and the content is engaging.
