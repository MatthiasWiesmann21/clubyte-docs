# Creating and Managing Courses as an Admin

This guide explains how Admins can create and manage courses on the Clubyte Community Pages. These courses will be displayed on the Course Page when published.

## Creating a Course

To create a course, follow these steps:

1. **Log in** to your Admin account.
2. **Navigate** to the Administration Sector via the main menu.
3. **Go to the Courses Section** and click on "Create New Course".

### Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Set the Title

Enter a title for your course in the title field. Ensure it is descriptive and relevant to the content to attract potential learners.

### 2. Enter the Description

Provide a detailed description of the course. This should include what the course covers, its objectives, and any prerequisites. Engaging descriptions can help capture the interest of prospective students.

### 3. Select a Category

Choose an appropriate category for your course. Proper categorization helps in organizing the content and makes it easier for users to find courses that match their interests.

### 4. Set a Price

Specify the price for your course. You can set it as free or paid, depending on the value and content of the course. Ensure the price reflects the quality and comprehensiveness of the material offered.

### 5. Add a Thumbnail Image

Upload an image that will serve as the thumbnail for your course. A visually appealing thumbnail can attract more users and give a professional look to your course.

### 6. Publish the Course

After entering all the necessary details, click on the "Publish" button to make your course live. Once published, it will be displayed on the Course Page for users to enroll.

## Creating Chapters

Once your course is created, you can enhance it by adding chapters. Each chapter can contain a title, description, and video.

### 1. Add a Chapter

In the course management section, click on "Add New Chapter" to start creating a new chapter for your course.

### 2. Set Chapter Details

Provide a title and description for the chapter. This should clearly outline what the chapter covers and its learning objectives.

### 3. Add a Video

You can add a video to the chapter by providing a YouTube or Vimeo link, or by uploading a video file directly. Ensure the video quality is high and the content is engaging.

### 4. Set Chapter as Access Free

If you want the chapter to be accessible for free, even if the user hasn't paid for the course, toggle the "Access Free" option. This can serve as a teaser to encourage users to purchase the full course.

### 5. Save the Chapter

After entering all the details, click on the "Save" button to add the chapter to your course. Repeat these steps to add more chapters as needed.

## User Interaction with the Course

Once a course and its chapters are published, users can interact with them in various ways to enhance their learning experience:

### Watching the Video

Users who have access to a chapter (whether paid or free) can watch the video provided in the chapter. This is the primary mode of content delivery.

### Navigating Through the Course

Users can navigate through different chapters of the course using the course navigation tools. This allows them to follow the course structure and progress through the material systematically.

### Liking the Chapter

Users can like a chapter by clicking the "Like" button. This feature helps indicate which chapters are particularly appreciated by the audience.

### Marking as Complete

Users can mark a chapter as complete once they finish it. This helps them keep track of their progress and encourages a sense of accomplishment.

### Writing a Comment

Users can leave comments on a chapter, providing feedback or engaging in discussions about the course content. This interaction can help improve the course and foster a community of learners.
