Provide a detailed description of the course. This should include what the course covers, its objectives, and any prerequisites. Engaging descriptions can help capture the interest of prospective students.

### 2.2. Add a Thumbnail Image

Upload an image that will serve as the thumbnail for your course. A visually appealing thumbnail can attract more users and give a professional look to your course.

### 2.3 Select a Category

Choose an appropriate category for your course. Proper categorization helps in organizing the content and makes it easier for users to find courses that match their interests. Keep in mind that beofre you can select a Category, you need to create one in the Admin Section.

### 2.4 (Optional) Set a dedicated Usergroup

Assign a specific user group to your course if applicable. This allows you to restrict access to certain users, such as members of an organization, premium subscribers, or a specific community segment. It ensures that your course reaches the intended audience while maintaining exclusivity if needed. Keep in mind that beofre you can select a Usergroup, you need to create one in the Admin Section.

### 2.5 (Optional) Set a Course Duration

Define the estimated duration of the course to give users a clear expectation of the time commitment required. You can specify this as the total hours or weeks the course will take. A well-defined duration helps users plan their learning schedules effectively.

### 2.6 (Optional) Set the Course Level

Select the difficulty level of your course, such as Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced. This information helps users determine whether the course aligns with their current skills and knowledge, ensuring a better learning experience.

### 2.7 (Optional) Set a Special Status of the Course

Highlight special characteristics of your course by assigning it a special status. Examples include Featured, Trending, or Exclusive. Special statuses can make your course stand out and attract more attention in your platformâ€™s course catalog.

### 2.8 (Optional) Set a Price

Specify the price for your course. You can set it as free (let it empty or put in zero) or paid, depending on the value and content of the course. Ensure the price reflects the quality and comprehensiveness of the material offered.

### 2.9 (Optional) Set Course Attachments

Upload supplementary materials for the course, such as PDFs, slides, worksheets, or additional readings. Providing these resources enhances the learning experience by allowing users to dive deeper into the subject matter or review materials offline.

### 2.10 Publish the Course

Once you have completed all the necessary steps and/or optional configurations, click on the Publish button to make your course live on the platform. Before publishing, review all details to ensure accuracy and a professional presentation. After publishing, users can access and enroll in your course.
