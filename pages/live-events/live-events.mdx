### 2. Entering the Description

Use the **Event Description** field to provide comprehensive details about the live event. Mention key topics, goals, and any information users need to know to prepare for the event.

### 3. Uploading a Thumbnail

Add a thumbnail image using the **Event Thumbnail** section. This image represents your event and plays a crucial role in capturing user attention. Ensure the image is high-quality and relevant.

### 4. Selecting a Category

Categorize the event in the **Event Category** field to make it easier for users to find events that match their interests. Choose from predefined categories or create a new one.

### 5. Assigning a User Group

Use the **Usergroup** section to specify which users can access the event. You can choose between "All Users" or specific user groups, depending on your event's target audience.

### 6. Setting Start and End Dates

In the **Start Date & Time** and **End Date & Time** fields, define when the event begins and ends. Precise scheduling ensures your event is visible and accessible at the right times.

### 7. Adding a Video

Upload a video file or provide a YouTube/Vimeo link in the **Live Event** section. This video serves as the central content for your event, so ensure it is well-produced and relevant.

### 8. Activating Stream Chat

Toggle the **Stream Chat** option to allow real-time interaction among users during the event. This feature fosters engagement and builds a sense of community.

### 9. Saving and Publishing

Click **Save** to store your changes. When you're ready to go live, use the "Publish" button. The event will then be visible to users and marked as "Live" once the start time arrives.
