To create a live event, follow these steps:

1. **Log in** to your Admin account.

### Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Set the Title

Enter a title for your live event in the title field. Ensure it is catchy and relevant to the content to attract potential attendees.

### 2. Enter the Description

Provide a detailed description of the live event. This should include what the event covers, its objectives, and any important details attendees should know.

### 3. Set Up a Thumbnail

Upload an image that will serve as the thumbnail for your live event. A visually appealing thumbnail can attract more users and give a professional look to your event.

### 4. Set Up a Category

Choose an appropriate category for your live event. Proper categorization helps in organizing the content and makes it easier for users to find events that match their interests.

### 5. Set Up Start and End Date

Specify the start and end date and time for your live event. This information is crucial for scheduling and ensuring users know when to attend.

### 6. Add a Video

You can add a video to the live event by providing a YouTube or Vimeo link, or by uploading a video file directly. Ensure the video quality is high and the content is engaging.

### 7. Publish the Event

After entering all the necessary details, click on the "Publish" button to make your event live. Once published, the event will be visible to users.
