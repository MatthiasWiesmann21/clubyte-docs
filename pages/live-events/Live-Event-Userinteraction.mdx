# Creating and Managing Live Events

This guide explains how to use and enjoy live events using Clubyte. Live events are an excellent way to engage with the Community in real-time, offering valuable content and fostering interaction.

Once a Live-Event is published, users can interact with them to enhance their Community experience:

The center of the page showcases the **Live Events Overview**, designed to display and manage all live events created on the platform. This section allows users and admins to view upcoming, ongoing, and past events at a glance.

### Key Components:

1. **Tabs for Event Filtering**  
   At the top of the Live Events section, there are tabs labeled **All**, **Future Events**, and **Past Events**.

   - **Future Events**: Focuses on events scheduled to happen in the future.  
   - **Past Events**: Filters events that have already occurred.

2. **Category Filters**  
   Below the tabs, categories are presented as clickable filters (e.g., "Advanced Web Development," "Cameron"). Selecting a category refines the list to show events tagged with the chosen category, helping users find specific types of events quickly.

3. **Event Card**  
   Each event is represented as a **card**, which contains the following elements:
   - **Thumbnail Image**: Displays the event's thumbnail for visual identification.  
   - **Event Date and Time**: Clearly indicates when the event is scheduled, making it easy for users to plan participation.  
   - **Event Category**: A label just below the thumbnail shows the category assigned to the event.  
   - **Event Title**: The title of the event is displayed prominently for easy recognition.  
   - **Actions Menu**: Below the event details, a series of icons provide quick actions:  
      - Bookmark or save the event.  
      - Share the event with others.
      - Saving the Event in the Users prefered Calendar  
      - Access additional options, such as viewing details or editing (for Admins).
