## User Guide: Chatting with Others

The Chat Page is the core area where users can engage in conversations via various **channels** and **direct messaging** options. Here's how you can make the most of the Chat Page functionality.

---

### Chat Servers and Channels

#### Chat Servers
At the **top-left corner**, the current **Chat Server** is displayed. Users are automatically added as members to the first chat server created by the admin. If there are multiple servers, users can seamlessly switch between them.

#### Channels
Each Chat Server contains various channels for communication:
- **Text Channels**: Designed for sending messages, sharing files, and using emojis, GIFs, or videos.
- **Audio Channels**: Allow for live voice-based conversations with other members.
- **Video Channels**: Enable group video calls for more interactive communication.

Users can switch between these channel types as needed to suit their preferred mode of communication.

### Members List

At the **bottom of the left sidebar**, the list of all members in the current chat server is displayed. This list allows you to:
- See all active members in the server.
- Start **direct messaging** with other users by selecting their profile from this list.

### Conversation Area

The **conversation area**, located on the right-hand side, is where all interactions take place. Depending on the selected context, this area displays:

#### Channel Rooms
Within **channel rooms**, members can:
- Write messages (in text channels).
- Join voice discussions (in audio channels).
- Participate in video calls (in video channels).

This is the main space for group communication in channels, where everyone who has access to the channel can see and contribute to the discussion.

#### Direct Messaging
When a specific user is selected from the **members list**, the conversation area switches to a **private chat**. Direct messaging enables private, one-on-one communication with options for:
- Text messages.
- File and media sharing.
- Emoji and GIF usage.

---

### Chat Input

At the bottom of the conversation area, the **chat input bar** allows users to:
- Type and send text messages.
- Attach files such as images or videos.

The input bar ensures easy access to all tools needed for rich and engaging conversations.
