# Chatting and Managing Chat Servers

This guide explains how users can chat with each other and how Admins and Operators can manage chat servers on the Clubyte Community Pages. The chat functionality is designed similarly to Discord, with various channels and direct messaging options.

## User Guide: Chatting with Others

The chat feature on Clubyte Community Pages allows users to communicate through various channels within one or more chat servers created by the Admin.

### Chat Servers and Channels

- **Chat Servers**: These are the main containers for chat activities. Each server can have multiple channels.
- **Channels**: There are different types of channels within each server:
  - **Text Channels**: For text-based conversations.
  - **Audio Channels**: For voice chats.
  - **Video Channels**: For video conferencing.

### Joining and Leaving Chat Servers

As a user, you can join chat servers that are available to you. Once you are part of a server, you can participate in the channels within that server. If you wish to leave a server, you can do so at any time.

### Direct Messaging

You can send direct messages to other users who are part of the same chat server. This allows for private conversations outside of the main channels.
