# The Analytics

### The page features a bar graph that visually represents the revenue for individual courses.

![Analytics Page](/Analytics-Page.png)

- **X-axis:** Displays the course names (e.g., `Test Course 3`, `Test Course 4`, `Test Course 2`).
- **Y-axis:** Shows the revenue amounts in dollar values, marked in increments (e.g., `$0`, `$5`, `$10`, `$15`, `$20`).

## Bar Graph Data

Each bar corresponds to a specific course:

1. For example, `Test Course 3` is represented with a bar at `$20`, while `Test Course 2` is at `$10`.
2. `Test Course 4` is displayed with a bar at `$0`, indicating no revenue was generated.

The Analytics Page focuses on providing a detailed visualization of revenue distribution across sold courses, allowing users to easily see the performance of each course in terms of revenue.
