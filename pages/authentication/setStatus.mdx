# Changing Your Profile Activity Status.

This guide explains how to change your current status on the Clubyte Community Pages. You can choose from several status options: "Online", "Not available", "Do Not Disturb", and "Invisible".

## How to Change Your Status

To change your status, follow these steps:

1. **Log in** to your account.
2. **Click on your profile image** at the top-right corner of the page.
3. **Select your status** from the dropdown menu.

### Status Options

#### 1. Online

When you set your status to "Online", other users can see that you are active and available for interaction. This status indicates that you are present and ready to communicate.

#### 2. Not Available

Setting your status to "Not Available" lets other users know that you are currently not available for interaction. This can be useful if you are busy or away from your device for a short period.

#### 3. Do Not Disturb

The "Do Not Disturb" status indicates that you do not want to be interrupted. Notifications may be silenced, and others will see that you prefer not to be contacted at the moment.

#### 4. Invisible

Setting your status to "Invisible" makes it appear as if you are offline. You can still use the community pages and interact with content, but other users will not see you as online.
