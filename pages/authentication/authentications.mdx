### Did Not Receive Email

If you did not receive the confirmation email, check your spam folder or request a new confirmation email from the login page.

## Signed-Up but didn't get in the application

If you correctly sign-up the first time and your landing on a blank page, please refresh/reload the page. This should reload the functions and you have then access to your Community Favorite Clubyte Container.
