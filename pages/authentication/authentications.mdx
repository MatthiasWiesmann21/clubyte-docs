## Step 2: Sign-In or Register

If you already have an account, enter your login credentials (email address and password or sign-in with google) and click "Login". If you don't have an account yet, click "Register" and follow the instructions to create an account.

## Step 3: Email Verification

After registration, you will receive a confirmation email. Open this email and you will be redirected back to the platform to verify your E-Mail Adress to your Account. If you can't find the email, please check your spam folder.

## Step 4: Complete the Sign-In

After verification, you need to accept the privacy policy and terms of use. After that, you will be redirected to your profile Page, to fill out your Profile. You can now start using the platform.


## Common Issues and Solutions

### Forgot Password

If you forgot your password, click on "Forgot Password?" on the login page. You first have to type in your E-Mail to see the forgot password link above the password input field. Enter your email address, and you will receive an email with instructions to reset your password.


### Did Not Receive Email

If you did not receive the confirmation email, check your spam folder or request a new confirmation email from the login page.

## Signed-Up but didn't get in the application

If you correctly sign-up the first time and your landing on a blank page, please refresh/reload the page. This should reload the functions and you have then access to your Community Favorite Clubyte Container.



With this guide, you should be able to authenticate on the Clubyte Community Pages without any issues. If you have further questions, please contact support at [support@clubyte.live](mailto:support@clubyte.live).
